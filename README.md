# Identification and quantification of non-coding RNAs (Moradi Marjaneh et al., *Genome Biology* 2020)

This repository provides bash scripts used for ncRNAs identification and quantification including: 

1. trimming the sequencing reads
2. *de novo* assembly
3. mapping back the *de novo* assemblies against the hg19 reference genome
4. merging assemblies
5. indexing
6. mapping the sequencing reads against the merged assembly
7. filtering for paired mapped reads  
8. sorting
9. merging sorted bam files for each library
10. indexing
11. quantification (gene and isoform level)
12. making genome level bam files
13. exon level quantification
